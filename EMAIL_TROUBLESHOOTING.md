## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUE: Gmail App Password Authentication

The main issue preventing emails from working is the Gmail App Password authentication. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ 2-Step Verification
3. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. In Google Account settings, go to Security â†’ App passwords
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Select "Other" as the device and name it "LinkedIn Follow-up App"
4. Copy the generated 16-character password (format: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Update your `backend/.env` file with the correct App Password:

```env
# Replace the current EMAIL_PASS with your new App Password
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password_here
EMAIL_USER=arsalankhan1102004@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM="Your App <arsalankhan1102004@gmail.com>"
```

### Step 4: Test Email Functionality
Run the test script to verify email is working:
```bash
cd backend
node testEmail.js
```

## Alternative Email Solutions

If Gmail continues to have issues, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Use SendGrid
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### Option 2: Use Mailgun
```bash
npm install mailgun-js
```

### Option 3: Use Outlook/Hotmail SMTP
Update `backend/utils/sendEmail.js`:
```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "hotmail",
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@outlook.com",
    pass: "your-password"
  }
});
```

## Testing the Complete Flow

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Registration Flow**:
   - Go to registration page
   - Fill out form and submit
   - Check email for OTP
   - Verify email with OTP

4. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Try logging in with verified account
   - Should work without issues

5. **Test Google Login**:
   - Should work immediately (no email verification needed)

## Current Status

âœ… **Fixed Issues**:
- Registration now sends verification emails automatically
- Google login users are properly verified
- Frontend environment variables configured
- Improved error handling in email utility

ðŸ”´ **Remaining Issue**:
